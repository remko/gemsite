title: "Sampling away with the SPD-S"

Lately, I have been searching for ways to trigger loops and samples from behind
my drum kit. After playing around with a less than ideal setup involving many
cables and devices (see below), I decided to buy myself a Roland SPD-S sampling
pad. Turned out to be a pretty good move !

About a year ago, I bought myself a Roland SPD-6 to start experimenting with
loops. I connected it via MIDI to my Edirol UA-25 interface, which in turn was
connected to my laptop. On the laptop, I used Ableton Live to trigger the
loops. To stay in sync with the loops, I started one measure of cowbell hits on
my Roland DR-770 rhythm box, sent it to one channel of my mini Behringer UB502
mixer, and connected the monitor mix of all other instruments (including the
UA-25) to another channel, outputting the UB502â€™s output to my headphones.
Although this setup worked for rehearsals, it should be obvious by now that
this wasnâ€™t very handy. Not only did this require *a lot* of connections and
devices, it was also very hard to keep the tempo in sync. Syncing the tempo
between the DR-770 and Ableton (with *another* MIDI cable) at least gave me a
central point where i could manage my tempo, but because of the way the MIDI
sync worked, it was hard to control just the rhythm box without interfering
with the loops. The SPD-6 also gave me a bit of trouble, in that it was hard to
program, and that it sometimes triggers if you hit its rim. On top of these
major inconveniences, I was a bit reluctant to start gigging with my PowerBook,
fearing that it probably wouldnâ€™t take long until some guy spilled beer all
over it, and of course that things would start crashing mid-gig (I have faith
in OS X, but not in Ableton and/or the UA-25 drivers). I considered buying a
Roland SP-404 rhythm sampler as a replacement for the Laptop/Ableton/UA-25
combo. After some testing, this seemed like a very cool device indeed, but the
on-screen display didnâ€™t seem enough (I like to see preset names on my
display), it had a sequencer i didnâ€™t really need, and I still would be left
with an extra device I had to drag around and connect. At just the extra 100
euros over the SP-404, I decided to buy an SPD-S.

After unpacking, the first thing I did was reset the memory. The few sounds I
heard sounded pretty decent, but you donâ€™t buy a sampling pad to play someone
elseâ€™s samples ðŸ˜‰) Importing my existing sample wave files through the
CompactFlash interface of the SPD-S was a breeze. I imported them directly to
CompactFlash memory, because the internal memory was full after importing the
samples of 3 songs. I also had to experiment with the three resolution settings
(*long*, *standard*, *fine*) to find out that *long* suffers from a good deal of
quality loss, whereas standard is nearly as good as *fine* (at half the space
requirements). The SPD-S gave me all the control I wanted to make performances
using the samples. I could even pan all the samples/loops to the left and pan a
metronome loop completely to the right, such that I could send one channel to
my headphones and the other to the mixing table. So, no need for an external
metronome anymore, nor entering the tempo manually (itâ€™s saved with the
performance). On top of that, I could create a â€˜panicâ€™ pad, which turns off all
the loops except the metronome, resulting in a perfect situation for live
performance. If you try this at home, donâ€™t forget to turn the ambience off, or
your metronome will leak through to your other channel. The sampling process
itself also seems decent. Using the â€˜auto-recordâ€™ function (which starts
recording based on input level) and the ability to synchronize the end of the
recording by entering the tempo in advance, it gives a pretty handy interface
to record loops. One thing I am missing though is the ability to enter the
number of measures to record, to have full automatic stop. Iâ€™m also not able to
stop recording with a foot switch (although you *can* do it for phrase
recording). I donâ€™t really use the begin/end marking features (yet): for more
complex sampling, I use software, and upload the loops afterwards.

In conclusion of this review, the SPD-S gives me all the features I need to
trigger loops from behind my drums, perfect for on stage performance, and it
brings them all in one device. With some pan trickery, I even obsoleted my
external metronome (although I lost the ability to use stereo samples this way,
but this doesnâ€™t seem like a problem on stage). Two thumbs up !
