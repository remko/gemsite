Exactly one year after we finished it, our book ["The First 10 Prolog Programming Contests"](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/ppcbook "The First 10 Prolog Programming Contests") is now freely downloadable. On the home page of the book,
you will also find the source code of all solutions presented in the book. 

Below are some pictures of the ‘deluxe’ edition of the book, hand-made by my mom.
