O’Reilly just sent us the cover for our [upcoming XMPP Book](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596157197 "XMPP: The Definitive Guide · O'Reilly"), and it seems we got the world’s smallest ungulate: [the lesser mouse-deer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchil "Kanchil · Wikipedia"). I haven’t seen one in real life before, am not sure I ever want to, but still: great! Have a look below to see what the cover of the book will look like when it hits the stores in 2 months.
